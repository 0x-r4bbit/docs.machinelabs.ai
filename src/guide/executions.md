### Private Beta

MachineLabs is currently in **Private Beta**. This basically means that people can't immediately start using all functions of the platform until their account gets activated.


## Signup & Login

As of today, there's no real signup process which basically means logging in with one of our OAuth providers is the entire signup process. Radically simple, no?

## OAuth Provider

We currently support *Login With GitHub* only but will support other OAuth provider in the future.
